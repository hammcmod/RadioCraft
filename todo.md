# Development Checklist

## Phase 1 – Core Gameplay Readiness

### Radios & Networking
- [x] Core HF radios (10m/20m/40m/80m) and their recipes are registered
- [ ] Provide working SWR and propagation hooks so core HF radios are usable
- [x] HF receiver, QRP radios, and the all-band radio shapeless combinations exist
- [x] VHF handhelds have functional radios

### Antennas & Signal Model
- [x] Dipole, end-fed, quarter-wave vertical, loop, wide-band receive, and VHF Yagi/J-pole/Slim Jim antennas are implemented
- [ ] Add runtime effects for antenna tuner and duplexer blocks (matching, losses, repeater protection) to unblock repeater work
- [ ] Implement antenna analyzer UI and data capture
- [ ] Implement shared antenna behavior hooks so antenna blocks drive propagation
- [ ] Hook SWR consequences (fire/destruction) into `RadioBlockEntity`
- [ ] Integrate solar event noise and day/night skip changes so HF radios gain or lose range based on `SolarEventManager`

### Events, Commands & Config
- [x] Callsign capability with `/callsign` tools implemented
- [ ] Implement administrative callsign commands (e.g., `/callsign set`) with permission checks
- [ ] Extend server config to cover callsign digit pools, HF static squelch, modern/vintage toggles, and “talk everywhere” overrides promised in the proposal
- [ ] Add `/bandcalculate` helper to complement antenna tuning

## Phase 2 – Power Systems

### Power & Components
- [ ] Make the solar panel and batteries actually use FE/other energy sources
- [x] Wire block recipe implemented
- [x] Waterproof wire crafting implemented
- [x] Radio crystal/speaker/microphone/HF circuit board recipes exist, albeit with lighter-cost ingredients than the proposal (iron/planks/redstone torch instead of diamond/iron)
- [ ] Finish small alkaline battery energy handling so `SmallBatteryItem` tracks charge and removes the “not implemented” message
- [ ] Implement handheld battery drain and Curios slot behavior in `VHFHandheldItem#inventoryTick`
- [ ] Implement large battery behavior (stacking capacity, discharge, explosion-on-fire) and update tooltips accordingly; power draw from radios should respect battery levels
- [x] Solar panel recipe uses glass + a daylight detector rather than kelp/iron
- [ ] Implement wire–water electrocution rules and battery ignition on short circuits in `WireBlock` and related power logic

### Radios & Networking
- [ ] Tie radio power draw, on/off state, and static playback into battery/solar networks via `RadioNetworkObject`
- [ ] Implement HF static/grounding modifiers and lightning spikes so propagation feedback reaches the player

## Phase 3 – Extended Systems & Content

### VHF/UHF Channel and Repeater Features
- [ ] Implement VHF repeater block entity, callsign prompt, duplexer validation, and sleep/wake cycle
- [ ] Add multi-channel scan indicator to VHF receiver UI

### Digital & APRS Features
- [ ] Implement digital interface/TNC block with data transfer, APRS messaging, and Curios integration
- [ ] Add `/aprs beacon` and `/aprs broadcast` commands plus in-game item transfer

### Antenna Expansions
- [ ] Implement Moxon antenna variants (VHF/10m/20m) and register antenna types
- [ ] Revisit delta loop construction to support triangular build flow and align analyzer messaging
- [ ] Add sag-varying visuals for long unsupported antenna wire runs

### World & Progression Additions
- [ ] Upgrade the solar weather station from a tooltip placeholder to a working block (paper consumption, coordinate calculator, comparator output)
- [ ] Improve wire spool storage UX (bulk crafting/collapse)
- [ ] Introduce random structures, auto-beacon radios, APRS Discord bridge, and external radio API hooks
- [ ] Align crafting costs (e.g., netherite-heavy radios) with the original spec or update the design doc to reflect lighter recipes
